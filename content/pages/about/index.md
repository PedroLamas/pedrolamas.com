My name is Pedro Lamas, Iâ€™m a Portuguese developer specialized in Microsoft Technologies, and this is my english blog for Windows and Windows Phone Development.

Back in the year 2000 I started working for a Portuguese company called [LiveSolutions](http://www.livesolutions.pt), mainly on a ASP.net powered ERP solution.

About 8 years later, I decided it was time to move and after a few smaller work experiences, I finally landed at [DevScope](http://www.devscope.net) (probably the most specialized company for Microsoft Technologies you can find in Portugal), working as a Senior Software Engineer.

In late 2012, I moved to [Bristol, UK](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bristol,+UK&hl=en&ll=51.454488,-2.587881&spn=0.011753,0.033023&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=60.158465,135.263672&hnear=Bristol,+City+of+Bristol,+United+Kingdom&t=m&z=16) where I started working for [Nokia](http://www.nokia.com) as a Senior Engineer.

In April 2014 with the acquisition of Nokia Devices and Services division by Microsoft, I became a [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) employee, still as a Senior Engineer on MixRadio.

By the end of 2014, I decided to move to London where I started working for [Sky](http://www.sky.com) on the Sky Go Silverlight plugins and apps.

In September 2015 I wanted to start something new and exciting, so I took the leap to create my own company, [Ample Roads](http://www.ampleroads.com), and go contracting, starting to work in Windows 10 development for Microsoft in their Reading HQ.

I'm a [Microsoft Certified Professional](about/mcp-transcript), a [Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer](2017-07-24-xamarin-certified-mobile-developer), and a [Microsoft Windows Development MVP](2017-03-02-awarded-microsoft-windows-development-mvp-2017)!
