<p>I recently migrated my blog to a new platform and may have broken a few links inadvertently!</p>

<p>If you don't mind, please <a href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}/issues/new?title=404%20Page%20Not%20Found&labels=bug">log an issue</a> with the URL you were trying to reach and where you found the URL. Thank you!</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link index.html %}">head back home</a> to try finding it again.</p>
